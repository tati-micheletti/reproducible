\usage{
cache(cacheRepo = NULL, FUN, ..., notOlderThan = NULL, objects = NULL,
  outputObjects = NULL, algo = "xxhash64")

\S4method{cache}{ANY}(cacheRepo = NULL, FUN, ..., notOlderThan = NULL,
  objects = NULL, outputObjects = NULL, algo = "xxhash64")
}
\arguments{
\item{cacheRepo}{A repository used for storing cached objects.
This is optional if \code{Cache} is used inside a SpaDES module.}

\item{FUN}{Either a function or an unevaluated function call (e.g., using
\code{quote}.}

\item{...}{Arguments of \code{FUN} function .}

\item{notOlderThan}{load an artifact from the database only if it was created after notOlderThan.}

\item{objects}{Character vector of objects to be digested. This is only applicable
if there is a list, environment (or similar) named objects
within it. Only this/these objects will be considered for caching,
i.e., only use a subset of
the list, environment or similar objects.}

\item{outputObjects}{Optional character vector indicating which objects to
return. This is only relevant for list, environment (or similar) objects}

\item{algo}{The algorithms to be used; currently available choices are
    \code{md5}, which is also the default, \code{sha1}, \code{crc32},
    \code{sha256}, \code{sha512}, \code{xxhash32}, \code{xxhash64} and
    \code{murmur32}.}
